        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base">Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence technology that can produce various types of content, including text, imagery, audio and synthetic data. The recent buzz around generative AI has been driven by the simplicity of new user interfaces for creating high-quality text, graphics and videos in a matter of seconds.</p>

            Generative AI works by using an ML model to learn the patterns and relationships in a dataset of human-created content. It then uses the learned patterns to generate new content. 
            The most common way to train a generative AI model is to use supervised learning - the model is given a set of human-created content and corresponding labels. It then learns to generate content that is similar to the human-created content and labeled with the same labels.</p>

            <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">Two additional recent advances that will be discussed in more detail below have played a critical part in generative AI going mainstream: transformers and the breakthrough language models they enabled. Transformers are a type of machine learning that made it possible for researchers to train ever-larger models without having to label all of the data in advance. New models could thus be trained on billions of pages of text, resulting in answers with more depth. In addition, transformers unlocked a new notion called attention that enabled models to track the connections between words across pages, chapters and books rather than just in individual sentences. And not just words: Transformers could also use their ability to track connections to analyze code, proteins, chemicals and DNA.

                The rapid advances in so-called large language models (LLMs) i.e., models with billions or even trillions of parameters have opened a new era in which generative AI models can write engaging text, paint photorealistic images and even create somewhat entertaining sitcoms on the fly. Moreover, innovations in multimodal AI enable teams to generate content across multiple types of media, including text, graphics and video. This is the basis for tools like Dall-E that automatically create images from a text description or generate text captions from images.
                
                These breakthroughs notwithstanding, we are still in the early days of using generative AI to create readable text and photorealistic stylized graphics. Early implementations have had issues with accuracy and bias, as well as being prone to hallucinations and spitting back weird answers. Still, progress thus far indicates that the inherent capabilities of this generative AI could fundamentally change enterprise technology how businesses operate. Going forward, this technology could help write code, design new drugs, develop products, redesign business processes and transform supply chains.</p>

        <h1 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl font-medium title-font mb-4 text-gray-900">What are Dall-E, ChatGPT and Bard?</h1>
        <h2 class="sm:text-3xl text-2xl font-medium title-font mb-4 text-gray-900">ChatGPT, Dall-E, and Bard are popular generative AI interfaces</h2>
        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base"><b>Dall-E.</b> Trained on a large data set of images and their associated text descriptions, Dall-E is an example of a multimodal AI application that identifies connections across multiple media, such as vision, text, and audio. In this case, it connects the meaning of words to visual elements. It was built using OpenAI's GPT implementation in 2021. Dall-E 2, a second, more capable version, was released in 2022. It enables users to generate imagery in multiple styles driven by user prompts.</p>

        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base"><b>ChatGPT.</b> The AI-powered chatbot that took the world by storm in November 2022 was built on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 implementation. OpenAI has provided a way to interact and fine-tune text responses via a chat interface with interactive feedback. Earlier versions of GPT were only accessible via an API. GPT-4 was released March 14, 2023. ChatGPT incorporates the history of its conversation with a user into its results, simulating a real conversation. After the incredible popularity of the new GPT interface, Microsoft announced a significant new investment into OpenAI and integrated a version of GPT into its Bing search engine.</p>
        <img src="bard.png" alt="AI image"></center>
        <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base"><b>Bard.</b> Google was another early leader in pioneering transformer AI techniques for processing language, proteins and other types of content. It open sourced some of these models for researchers. However, it never released a public interface for these models. Microsoft's decision to implement GPT into Bing drove Google to rush to market a public-facing chatbot, Google Bard, built on a lightweight version of its LaMDA family of large language models. Google suffered a significant loss in stock price following Bard's rushed debut after the language model incorrectly said the Webb telescope was the first to discover a planet in a foreign solar system. Meanwhile, Microsoft and ChatGPT implementations also lost face in their early outings due to inaccurate results and erratic behavior. Google has since unveiled a new version of Bard built on its most advanced LLM, PaLM 2, which allows Bard to be more efficient and visual in its response to user queries.</p>
